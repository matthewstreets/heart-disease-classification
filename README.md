# Heart Disease Classification

This project uses a dataset created by Kaggle user [fedesoriano](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) to predict whether an individual has heart disease. It is a classic example of a classification task. Various machine learning methods are used and these are evaluated to determine the highest and lowest performers.
